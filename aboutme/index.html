    <h2>Name: Uwa Joseph</h2>
    <h2>Nickname: Uncle Joe</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone, my name is Uwa Joseph, from Cross River State, Nigeria, 
    but resides in Akwa Ibom State, Uyo. I am single, and a recent graduate who
    studied Electrical and Electronic Engineering (B.Eng), University of Uyo,Uyo.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for over
    11 years. I was baptised into the church on 28th July 2012( I still remember the date).
    2 years later as a member, I proceeded to serve a full-time mission, out of an indepth 
    desire. I was called to labour in Nigeria Enugu Mission (November 2014 - November 2016). 
    This decision to serve has actually blessed my life tremenduously in many ways I cannot explain.  </p>
    <p>Currently, I am awaiting my NYSC mobilization, but do not intend to have a boring year, so I 
    followed my passion on Software, and decided to get a second degree on Software Development here in 
    BYU-Idaho. And I am grateful to Hevenly Father for providng such a low cost education with a lot of benefits.</p>
    <p>Thank you, for taking your time to read about me. Looking forward to getting to know you all. Bravo mates!!!</p>
